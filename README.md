# PlacementPrediction-Analysis
This project is trained on a real placement and internship data of a government run university. The project aims to analyse the technical careers for Women post covid, and provides insights on that. Furthermore, I have created a simple predictor that performs binary classification based on a number of inputs and classifies possibility of placement.
